I am creating this as a part of the Complete flutter course made in coodination with google. this is the first app built and I wanted to have a repo that went over each lesson. You can switch between the branches to check out the notes developed and how the code changed. The link to the original course is found here: https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart

the full repo with the complete code can be found here: https://github.com/londonappbrewery/Flutter-Course-Resources

This is the most comprehensive course I have found and if you want to be production ready with flutter then start with this course from Udemy if possible. # i_am_rich
